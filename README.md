# strands


I developed the backend logic for the game Strands, where the input includes the size of the grid (defined by rows and columns) and a series of letters. My code processes this input to generate the game board, ensuring that the grid size dynamically adjusts based on the provided dimensions. It efficiently handles letter placement within the grid, managing any constraints required by the game mechanics, while also ensuring performance optimization for handling larger grids.
